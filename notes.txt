After running npm, make this change in the bundle as a work-around for a geocrotex reporting bug

The fix is a single line in the bundle.js file in the developer sdk:

headers:{"Content-Type":"application/json",Authorization:i}};

Becomes

headers:{"Content-Type":"application/json"}};if(i){f.headers.Authorization=i};
